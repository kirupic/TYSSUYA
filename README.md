# TYSSUYA
TYSSUYA is a simple webpage that provides daily examples of Thing—ã You Should Shove Up Your Ass. Has a neat color palette called Catpuccin

 ## Current plan:
- add the 'copy reminder' functionality
- make a todo list where users can check the objects they have already shoved up their asses
- minor layout changes
